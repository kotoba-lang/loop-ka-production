(ns loop-ka.evaluate
  "evaluate — read the producer's own report of what each leg actually did.

  This namespace deliberately does NOT score craft. The repository-rules
  `loop-*` contract forbids owning domain scoring truth, and there is a concrete
  reason here beyond compliance: quality already has homes (design-quality's
  fitness functions, the gen-quality ledger's ffprobe metrics). What has NO home
  is the question this loop must answer before publishing — *did the generative
  legs actually run, or did the pipeline degrade and produce something that
  merely plays?*

  That question is answerable from the producer's `:legs` map alone, which is
  why dougaka.pipeline emits one: per-shot :murakumo/:comfy/:placeholder for the
  image, :murakumo/:local/:silent for the voice, plus whether a bed and cues
  landed. Two weeks of flat-colour cards shipped nightly because nothing looked
  at it."
