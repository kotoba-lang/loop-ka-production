  three ways. murakumo's fleet task plane (`murakumo task run --tasks
  tasks.edn`) is the resident path, because that plane already owns placement,
  slots, load admission and the retry/report ledger. A laptop under launchd is
  the fallback. A single `--channel` invocation is how an operator reproduces
  one run by hand.

  So this namespace emits a plain data batch and nothing executes here."
