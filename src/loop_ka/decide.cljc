  The loop never publishes anything itself; the publish key belongs to the
  channel's own actor. What it decides is whether to ASK the channel to publish,
  and that decision is the whole point of measuring the legs.

  Phases mirror the -ka actors' existing rollout vocabulary (dougaka-actor /

  needs a standing grant or a per-episode human sign-off."
