  "record-evidence — one append-only record per production run.

  Append-only on purpose. CLAUDE.md's docs rule is 'documents show the latest
  state, git holds history' — with a named exception for measurement and event
  series, because overwriting them destroys the series. A production run is an
  event: it happened, at a time, with a verdict, and produced these CIDs. Last
  night's degraded run is not superseded by tonight's clean one; both are facts.

  This is also the read surface cloud-itonami-app renders. The app does not need
  the loop's code, only this shape, so the record carries everything a human
  needs to judge a run — the verdict in words, the decision and its reason, and
  the CIDs to fetch the artifact — and nothing they cannot act on.

  Entities carry `:source/dataset \"loop-ka-production\"` so the workspace's
  DataScript plane can query runs alongside the other datasets. NOTE: kotobase's
  Datalog reaches exactly one ref (CLAUDE.md), so if these records are to join
  with repo-maturity / fleet / market-intel they must live on the SAME ref as
  those. Choosing a separate ref for write throughput would make that join
  impossible, permanently."
