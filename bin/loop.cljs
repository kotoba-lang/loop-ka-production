(ns loop
  "nbb CLI for the -ka production loop: observe -> evaluate -> decide -> act ->
  record-evidence.

  Deliberately provider-neutral (the `loop-*` contract forbids binding to one
  runner). `plan` emits a murakumo task batch and stops; the resident path is
  `murakumo task run --tasks`, but the same batch runs under launchd or by hand.

    nbb --classpath src:resources bin/loop.cljs observe [--date YYYY-MM-DD] [--slot 0]
    nbb ... bin/loop.cljs plan   --workspace <dir> [--out tasks.edn]
    nbb ... bin/loop.cljs record --channel dougaka --episode <id> --legs legs.edn
                                 [--phase 1] [--approve publish]
    nbb ... bin/loop.cljs report [--last 20]

  `observe` and `plan` never execute a producer and never publish. `record` is
  what a producer calls when it finishes: it grades the run's own :legs report,
  decides publish/hold/discard, and appends the evidence. The publish itself
  stays in the channel's repo with the channel's key — this loop holds no
  publishing key and mints no CACAO."
